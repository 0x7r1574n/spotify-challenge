# spotify-challenge

This is an interactive web application that utilizes Spotify's RESTful API's search endpoint.

Users are prompted to enter a sentence with more than 2 characters, and the application will search for each word and randomly select a related track and display its information on the fly. Due to the API's constraint, each word should exist in the track name for the most time, but it is not guaranteed.
